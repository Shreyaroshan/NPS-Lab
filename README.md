# Network Programming and Simulation Lab 

This repository contains solutions and implementations for the Network Programming and Simulation Lab. The lab focuses on client-server architecture using socket programming and simulating network scenarios using Cisco Packet Tracer.

## Contents

- **Socket Programming Labs**: Implementation of TCP and UDP based communication, chat servers, file transfers, DNS simulation, and database interactions.
- **Cisco Packet Tracer Labs**: Simulation of basic to advanced network setups including routing protocols, DHCP, NAT, wireless topologies, and VOIP.

## Topics Covered

- Client-server communication using sockets (TCP/UDP)
- File transfer and database access over networks
- Error detection/correction and congestion control
- Network modeling using Cisco Packet Tracer
- DNS, DHCP, NAT and routing simulations

## Tools Used

- GCC (C Programming)
- Cisco Packet Tracer (v8.x recommended)
- Linux environment for compilation and execution
